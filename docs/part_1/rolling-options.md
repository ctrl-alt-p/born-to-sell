# Rolling Options
When you have a covered call position, you can roll it by buying back the current option and selling a new option.  The strike price and expiration may be different from the first option.

You should be come comfortable with rolling a covered call position.  It is an important part of building a profitable portfolio.

## Reasons to roll your position:
- The option is expiring soon and underlying stock goes down
- The option is expiring soon and underlying stock goes up
- The option is expiring soon it has decreased in value, making it cheap to buy back.
- The option is expiring soon and the stock is about to go ex-dividend-date.
- The account is a taxable account and you don't want to take the tax hit for the stock getting sold.

As you can see the the benefit of covered call investing you can collect the time premium.  When the option has very little time premium remaining it can be brought back and you can sell another option that has more time premium.

## Reasons not to roll your position:
- The option is expiring today and the option is out of the money (OTM).
- Let the option expire and sell a new option on Monday.  This is only the best choice when the expiring option is very inexpensive and the option market is liquid.
- The account is tax-free, so you can buy it back later without worrying about the tax hit.
