# Monthly Income
Covered calls are excellent because you can sell multiple calls against the same stock over time.  As long as you retain the stock it is possible to generate recurring monthly income by selling calls month over month.  If the covered call is exercised you can re-purchase the shares and sell a new call contract against the stock.

## Example Covered calls
- VWO is trading at $60/share today.
- You purchase 100 shares of VWO at $60.
- You sell a call contract for $2/share at a strike-price of $65
- You repeat the process at the end of the 1st month.
- You repeat the process at the end of the 2nd month.
- At the end of the 3rd month the call contract is exercised and the shares are sold.

Breakdown of the transactions over the 3 months:
1. Buy 100x VWO at $60 ==> (-$6000)
2. Sell 1x call $2@65  ==> (-$5800) = -$6000 + $200
3. Option expires worthless 1 month later.  Stock is at $62
4. Sell 1x call $3@65  ==> (-$5500) = -$5800 + $300
5. Option expires worthless 1 month later.  Stock is at $58
6. Sell 1x call $2.5@60  ==> (-$5250) = -$5500 + $250
7. Option expires in the money 1 month later.  Stock is at $62
8. You make $750 from the call contracts, and $200 from the stock.
9. Net income is $950 for 3 months.
