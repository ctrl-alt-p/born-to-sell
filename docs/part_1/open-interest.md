# OI: Open Interest
Open Interest counts the number of contracts at a specific expiration and strike price for a specific stock.  Usually the greater the open interest the more liquid the options contracts, which in turn means a smaller delta between the option bid & ask prices.  

> The normal filter for highly liquid options is OI >= 1000.  

When you are first begin writing covered calls you should stick to options with OI >= 1000.  They will be the most stable and liquid options for your portfolio.
