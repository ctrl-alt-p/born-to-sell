# Options Explained
One option contract controls 100 shares of stock.  

Options are quoted on a per-share basis:
- The option price is $1.50
- You will be paid $150 per contract ($1.50 * 100 shares = $150)

You can only sell 1 contract per 100 shares you own:
- 100 shares <=> 1 call contract ==> you receive $150
- 500 shares <=> 5 call contracts ==> you receive $750 ($150 * 5)
