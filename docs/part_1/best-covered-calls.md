# Best Covered Calls
You've read the all the tutorials so far, so you understand how they work.   What do do next? First thing, you need to do your own research and pick companies that you like enough to hold the stock.

## The option to write depends on:
1 How long should the option have before it expires (1 month, 2 months, etc). 1 Where do you think the stock price will be when the option expires.

## How to choose an expiration month:
1 Avoid short-term options that expire near next earnings release.  There may be significant volatility in the stock price leading up to and immediately after earnings are released. 1 The value of an option decays more quickly in the last month, which is to your advantage as the seller. 1 Often you can generate more profits from selling a series of 1 month options instead of a single longer term option.

## How to choose a strike price:
1 If you think the stock will go down, look at in-the-money (ITM) strike prices.  The lower strike price will create a larger premium for you and provide downside(loss) protection. 1 If you think the stock will go up, look at out-of-the-money (OTM) strike prices.  The higher strike price will create a gap which allows you to capture some of the up swing.

## Covered Calls as a source of income:
When using covered calls for income ITM options are the best way to go.  ITM options used when you not targeting capital appreciation and would like the most downside protection possible.  This is often used as a conservative investment style where the strike price should be 10%, 15%, or 20% ITM.
