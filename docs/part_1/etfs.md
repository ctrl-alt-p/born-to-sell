# Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
An ETF is an entity containing a collection of stocks that trade like a stock.  

Here are a few examples of ETFs:
- IWM is an ETF comprised of 2000 stocks (the Russell 2000).
- QQQ (NASDAQ 100)
- SPY (S&P 500)
- DIA (Dow Jones Industrial Average).

## What's the benefit of using an ETF for covered calls?
Diversification provided by an ETF and potentially lower volatility.  An ETF reduces the single-stock risk, providing a more consistent price action for an ETF.  Traditionally speaking some investors avoid single-stock risk because an individual company or industry that can cause dramatic price movement.

For the risk-averse investor this is usually a good route to follow.  Unfortunately the diversification results in lover volatility, thus the time premium you can collect is lower.

## ETFs can be engineered to be volatile:
An ETF can be leveraged, providing stronger price action than the underlying would normally provide.  Leveraged ETFs can be very effective when selling covered calls since the premium is higher.  Be more careful with leveraged ETFs, they can be very volatile to enter or exit.
