# Option Exercise
In the option world you are the seller.  The buyer of a call option has the right to buy your stock at the strike price by the expiration date.  The the buyer your stock at the strike price, the buyer will exercise the call contract and force you to sell your stock to him at the strike price.

The buyer can exercised the contract at any time on or before the expiration date.  When an option is exercised before expiration, it is called early exercise.  Early exercise may happen if the underlying stock is about to pay a dividend or is highly volatile.

Having an option exercised is common when executing a covered call strategy.  It is normal and should be expected to occur for ITM options and stocks with dividends.  Since the majority of options expire without being exercised this is not a frequent event for OTM stocks.
