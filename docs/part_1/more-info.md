# More Info
Experience with covered calls is easy to obtain since you can paper trade with Dough.com or TD Ameritrade. `Paper trading` means that so you can enter stock and option positions as if they were real trades and then watch them to see how they behave over time (without risking real capital), because there is no linkage to any actual brokerage accounts
