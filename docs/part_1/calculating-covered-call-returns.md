# Calculating Returns
There are several types of profit calculations used when calculating covered call returns.

## Return types:
### Return If Flat
Return If Flat is the return percentage if the stock price remains unchanged or decreases between now and expiration.

> Return If Flat = Time Premium / Net Debit * 100%

### Return If Called
Return If Called is the return percentage if the stock price exceeds the strike price or is exercised.

> Return If Called = (Strike Price - Net Debit) / Net Debit * 100%

## Annualized Returns
To know how much money you can make per year we use annualized returns.  To calculate an annualized return take the percentage of the year for  holding period (ex 1% in 30 days ==> 12%/year).  

> Annualized Return = Return * Holding Period Days / 365 days

> Annualized Return = 41% <=> 5% * 30 days / 365 days
