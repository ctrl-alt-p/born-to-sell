# Call vs Put
There are two kinds of options you can trade: `calls` and `puts`.  A put lets you sell 100 shares of stock at a specific price. A call lets you buy 100 shares of stock at a specific price.  You can buy or sell these the build very profitable positions.

## Call Options
A call option is a tradable security that gives the buyer of the call option the right to buy stock at a certain price ("strike price") on or before a certain date ("expiration date"). Likewise, the seller of a call option is obligated to sell stock at a certain price by a certain date if the buyer chooses to exercise his right.

## Put Options
A put option is the opposite of a call option: it is the right to sell a stock at a certain price by a certain date. Born To Sell is not concerned with put options and will focus this tutorial on call options and covered calls.
