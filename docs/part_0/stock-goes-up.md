# What happens if the stock goes up?
What happens if you write a covered call - and then your underlying stock shoots skyward, exceeding the option's strike price? In that case, the option buyer has reason to exercise his or her call option because buying the stock for the strike price is cheaper than buying the stock in the open market. This is called being in-the-money. In that scenario your shares will mostly likely be called away from you. You might be sad to part with your stock and miss out on some of those gains - but the scenario holds some benefits for you.

For example, let's imagine XYZ shoots from $50 to $65, and you've sold a March 55 covered call. In this scenario, the option buyer is extremely likely to exercise his or her right to buy the underlying shares. After all, the call option allows the buyer to purchase XYZ at only $55 when everyone else has to pay $65 - a difference of $10 per share.

As the covered call writer, you haven't made out too badly either. When you sold the call, the stock was $50, and now you're cashing in at $55 - that's a profit of 10% on the stock alone. Plus you get to keep the $2.50 premium you collected when selling the covered call in the first place - an additional 5%. Not too shabby. Anytime you enter into a covered call position, you must be willing to part with the stock at the strike price. So pick a strike price that will account for enough gains that you won't feel sorry for yourself if your stock gets called away.
