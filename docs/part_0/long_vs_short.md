# Trading positions
There are two ways of trading positions: `long` and `short`.  You would short something, sell something you don't own, because you expect it to fall in value.  You would long something, buy something so you now own it, because you expect it to rise in value.

## Long Positions
You are long a security if you own the security. You bought it, you own it, and you will profit if it goes up in value. This is the normal case for most investors. You buy 100 shares of VWO stock, and now you are long VWO.

## Short Positions
On the other hand, you are short a security if you have sold it without owning it. Short sellers will buy the security back at a later date (i.e. they cover their short position in the future by buying what they had previously sold).
