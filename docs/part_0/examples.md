# An example of a covered call?
Stock commission   = $7   (flat rate)

Options commission = $1.5 ($0.15 * 100 shares)
1. You buy 100 shares of VWO at $25.  This costs you $2507 ( $25 * 100shares + $7commission )
2. VWO is now trading at $25 per share, but it doesn't seem likely to rise much in the short-term.  Still, you're long-term bullish on VWO and want to see if you can make a little extra cash while waiting for a bigger bump in the stock.
3. You now sell one covered call contract on VWO for $2.50/option, the strike price is $30, and it expires in 3 months.  The premium you collect is $2.50 per option, or $250 ($2.50 x 100 shares = $250) less commissions of $1.5.
4. If VWO stays around $25 until expiration, the call would be out-of-the-money.  That means buying the stock for the strike price ($30) is more expensive than buying the stock in the open market ($25).  So the option buyer would most likely not exercise the call and the option would expire worthless.  You pocket the $250 premium AND keep your 100 shares of VWO.  Keep in mind, as long as the options you sell don't get exercised, you can repeat this maneuver from month to month, selling additional covered calls against the same shares of stock.
5. If VWO goes above $30 at expiration, the call would be in-the-money.  That means buying the stock for the strike price ($30) is less expensive than buying the stock in the open market (ex $30.01).  So the option buyer would most likely exercise the call and the take your 100 shares.  You pocket the $250 premium AND get paid $500 for your 100 shares of VWO ( ($30-$25) * 100 = $500).  Keep in mind, you can always buy more shares of the stock and repeat this maneuver from month to month, selling additional covered calls against the same shares of stock.
