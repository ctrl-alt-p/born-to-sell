# Part II: Setting up your Account
## Requirements
In order to write covered calls you will need a few things:
1. A self directed brokerage account with a broker (e.g. TD Ameritrade). You can write covered calls in a regular account or most retirement accounts (ex an IRA).
2. Permission to use margin, most brokers will require you have a Tier 2(margin/standard) or Tier 3(advanced) account.
3. 100 or more shares of a liquid stock, or enough cash to buy 100 shares. Ideally you have enough stock or cash so that you can own 100 shares of several different companies.
4. A high-quality trade selection and portfolio monitoring service (see Part 3 of the guide).
5. Writing covered calls is a simple investment strategy you can do. It does not take much time to learn, execute, or to follow the trades. Anyone can write covered calls on stocks they own. It's the first options trade most people learn when they start trading options, and it's also the most popular options-based trading strategy (4 out of 5 option investors write covered calls). Let's see how it's done...
