# Welcome
Welcome to stock options!  Whether you are an experienced investor or a beginner, this is a great place to start.

This guide is designed to do two things: teach you covered call investing, and helping you build profitable investing strategies.

This tutorial will provide you with the basic knowledge, tools, and techniques you need to understand covered call investing.

Here's a fun fact to get you excited:

> Over 75% of all options held until expiration expire worthless.

> That's why you should do what the pros do and SELL options to other people.

> After all, if most of them will expire worthless, why not collect some money for them today while they still have value?

`Disclaimer`: Investing in covered calls is not a get rich quick strategy.  Covered calls is an income oriented approach that focuses on receiving premium payments every month.  This tutorial contains lessons that will teach you the advantages, risks, and rewards of option investing.
